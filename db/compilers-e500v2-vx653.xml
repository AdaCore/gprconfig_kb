  <!-- WRS gcc -v or -dumpmachine have different results depending on
       the version: on 2.3.0.1 and before, it would return
       powerpc-wrs-vxworksae; on 2.4 and later it would return
       powerpc-wrs-vxworks. That (plus the fact the e500v2 and ppc
       compilers use the same executables: ccppc and c++ppc) makes
       us specify one compiler description per CPU. In each of these
       descriptions, the target is hard-coded instead of being deduced
       from cc${PREFIX} -v.  -->
