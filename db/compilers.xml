  <!--    GCC 3.x
    These versions of GCC provide no specific switch to get the list of
    supported languages, but we can parse the output of gcc -v.
    We filter out some of the languages, since for instance Ada is handled
    directly by GNAT, not through GCC (which doesn't necessarily have an
    Ada runtime installed anyway.

    There is no switch, in such versions, to find out the list of languages,

    To find the list of supported runtimes, we check the contents of the

    we also accept lib/gcc-lib as the directory that contains the runtime files
