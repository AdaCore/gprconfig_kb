KP-110-H404-017 gprbuild should fails for declared source not found

  Problem:    gprbuild does not detect that a source, declared with
              attribute Source_Files or Source_List_File cannot be found.
              It sjould fail in this case.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.2.0 on 2008-03-05

  Workaround: Do not declare sources that do not exist
