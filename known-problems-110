The following is a listing of known problems in release 1.1.0. Except where
specifically noted, all these problems have been corrected in the development
tree of the 1.2 technology. This means they are corrected in any 1.2.0w
wavefront issued subsequent to the date specified (in ISO format YYYY-MM-DD) in
the status line. This can be used to determine if a given wavefront has the fix
identified in the entry.

KP-110-H513-007 Errors when testing for a subunit

  Problem:    When an Ada body source without spec that contains preprocessing
              lines in the with clauses is tested to see if it is a subunit,
              gprbuild fails with scanning errors.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.2.0 on 2008-05-13

  Workaround: Avoid preprocessing directives in with clauses

KP-110-H507-025 Unexpected recompilation of sources with very long names

  Problem:    When a non Ada source has a very long name, gprbuild may
              recompile it even if it is up to date.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.2.0 on 2008-05-07

  Workaround: Shorten the source file name

KP-110-H502-028 ALI files in extending library projects

  Problem:   When sources of library projects being extended where up to date,
             when building an extending library project, gprlib was not looking
             for the ALI files in the object directories of the projects being
             extended.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.2.0 on 2008-05-02

  Workaround: Invoke gprbuild with -f

KP-110-H421-024 Find correctly all Ada sources

  Problem:    When the naming scheme is seemingly ambiguous such that the same
              file could be of two kinds (spec/body) (example spec suffix =
              "_.ada", body suffix = ".ada") the project manager was not always
              finding all the sources.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.2.0 on 2008-04-22

  Workaround: Use a non ambiguous naming scheme

KP-110-H404-017 gprbuild should fails for declared source not found

  Problem:    gprbuild does not detect that a source, declared with
              attribute Source_Files or Source_List_File cannot be found.
              It should fail in this case.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.2.0 on 2008-04-05

  Workaround: Do not declare sources that do not exist
