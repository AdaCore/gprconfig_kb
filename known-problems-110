The following is a listing of known problems in release 1.1.0. Except where
specifically noted, all these problems have been corrected in the development
tree of the 1.2 technology. This means they are corrected in any 1.2.0w
wavefront issued subsequent to the date specified (in ISO format YYYY-MM-DD) in
the status line. This can be used to determine if a given wavefront has the fix
identified in the entry.

KP-110-H930-023 Wrong placement of linking options from the binding phase

  Problem:    Linking options coming from the binding phase that may be needed
              by object files are incorrectly placed before the object files in
              the invocation of the linker.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.2.0 on 2008-10-13

  Workaround: Repeat these linking options in the linker options.

KP-110-H814-019 Main on the command line for a library project

  Problem:    gprbuild does not fail when a main is specified on the command
              line for a main library project file. It should fail.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.2.0 on 2008-08-14

  Workaround: Avoid specifying mains on the command line for a library project

KP-110-H721-016 Externally built projects and switch -s

  Problem:    When switch -s is used, gprbuild may attempt to compile
              code from externally built projects.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.2.0 on 2008-07-21

  Workaround: Do not use switch -s in this case.

KP-110-H708-011 Config file not searched in original project

  Problem:    When a config file is specified in a project A without sources
              and the package Builder or Compiler of project A is renamed in
              another project B, the config file is not found for project B.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.2.0 on 2008-07-08

  Workaround: Copy the config file in the relevant project.

KP-110-H702-026 Failure to find Ada source in MixedCase

  Problem:    When the casing is specified as MixedCase, gprbuild fails to
              find Ada sources with file names that include capital letters.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.2.0 on 2008-07-02

  Workaround: Use only sources with small letters.

KP-110-H513-007 Errors when testing for a subunit

  Problem:    When an Ada body source without spec that contains preprocessing
              lines in the with clauses is tested to see if it is a subunit,
              gprbuild fails with scanning errors.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.2.0 on 2008-05-13

  Workaround: Avoid preprocessing directives in with clauses

KP-110-H507-025 Unexpected recompilation of sources with very long names

  Problem:    When a non Ada source has a very long name, gprbuild may
              recompile it even if it is up to date.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.2.0 on 2008-05-07

  Workaround: Shorten the source file name

KP-110-H502-028 ALI files in extending library projects

  Problem:   When sources of library projects being extended where up to date,
             when building an extending library project, gprlib was not looking
             for the ALI files in the object directories of the projects being
             extended.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.2.0 on 2008-05-02

  Workaround: Invoke gprbuild with -f

KP-110-H429-018 Crash when building a library with assembler sources

  Problem:    gprlib crashes when a library includes sources that have no
              dependency files.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.2.0 on 2008-04-30

  Workaround: Avoid sources with no dependency files in libraries

KP-110-H424-029 gprbuild does not take into account Library_GCC

  Problem:    gprbuild does not use the driver specified with attribute
              Library_GCC to link shared libraries.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.2.0 on 2008-04-25

  Workaround: Make shared libraries linkable using gcc.

KP-110-H421-024 Find correctly all Ada sources

  Problem:    When the naming scheme is seemingly ambiguous such that the same
              file could be of two kinds (spec/body) (example spec suffix =
              "_.ada", body suffix = ".ada") the project manager was not always
              finding all the sources.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.2.0 on 2008-04-22

  Workaround: Use a non ambiguous naming scheme

KP-110-H404-017 gprbuild should fails for declared source not found

  Problem:    gprbuild does not detect that a source, declared with
              attribute Source_Files or Source_List_File cannot be found.
              It should fail in this case.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.2.0 on 2008-04-05

  Workaround: Do not declare sources that do not exist
