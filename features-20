User's Guide.

NF-20-M121-032 Switches --RTS for gprclean (2013-01-21)

  gprclean may now be called with switches --RTS= or --RTS:<lang>=. The
  runtimes specified with these switches are taken into account in the
  invocation of gprconfig in auto-configuration. This allows gprclean to
  have more accurate file names to delete, for example when the executable
  extension depends on the runtime.

NF-20-LA23-043 Unconditionally create --autoconf= path (2012-10-26)

  gprbuild now creates unconditionally the directory of the configuration
  project file specified with --autoconf= when this directory does not exist.

NF-20-L924-049 Add support for arbitrary runtimes for GNAT (2012-09-30)

  The names of the runtimes for GNAT are no longer limited to a restricted
  list.

NF-20-L918-009 Add support for Windows resources (2012-10-03)

  Support for compiling Windows resources file with the binutils's
  windres compiler has been added.

NF-20-L908-003 Add aggregate project support for gprinstall (2012-09-08)

  gprinstall can now be used to install aggregate projects.

NF-20-L906-035 Add aggregate library project support to gprinstall (2012-09-08)

  gprinstall can now be used to install aggregate library projects.

NF-20-L126-014 Verbosity when linking shared SALs (2012-01-26)

  In default mode (not verbose and not quiet), the base name of gnatbind and
  of the compiler when binding and compiling the binder generated file is now
  output, instead of the full path names. Also, when the command line is long,
  only the beginning is output.

NF-20-KC19-034 Support for VxWorks Linux (2012-04-11)

  gprbuild now support VxWorks Linux targets.

NF-20-K623-010 New switch --validate for gprconfig (2012-01-04)

  knowledge base. It should be used when you add your own XML files.

NF-20-JC09-030 New package Clean in project file (2012-03-30)

  A new package Clean is added in project files. It can contain declarations
  of attributes Source_Artifact_Extensions and Object_Artifact_Extensions,
  that specify the extensions of files whose names are derived from source or
  object file names, that reside in the object directory and that are to be
  cleaned by gprclean.

NF-20-H729-014 New tool named gprinstall (2012-05-18)
