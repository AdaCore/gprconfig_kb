GPRBUILD 2.1 NEW FEATURES LIST
==============================

Copyright (C) 2012-2013, AdaCore

This file contains a complete list of new features in version 2.0 of GPRBUILD.
A full description of all GPRBUILD features can be found in the GPRBUILD
User's Guide.

NF-21-M405-028 gprinstall now supports cross-environment (2013-04-05)

  gprinstall will work in cross-environment by using the newly added
  --target option. This way it is possible to install a .dll created
  from a Windows cross-compiler on GNU/Linux for example.

NF-21-M304-056 gprinstall now preserves timestamps (2013-03-05)

  gprinstall now preserves timestamps when copying the source files,
  object files and libraries.

NF-21-M121-032 Switches --RTS for gprclean (2013-01-21)

  gprclean may now be called with switches --RTS= or --RTS:<lang>=. The
  runtimes specified with these switches are taken into account in the
  invocation of gprconfig in auto-configuration. This allows gprclean to
  have more accurate file names to delete, for example when the executable
  extension depends on the runtime.

NF-21-LC19-034 Project_Path searched before ADA_PROJECT_PATH (2013-01-04)

  Project_Path values are searched before ADA_PROJECT_PATH. This behavior
  is better as if Project_Path is defined for the aggregate project we
  do not want to pick a random project found in ADA_PROJECT_PATH.

NF-21-LA25-026 Aggregate projects and auto-configuration (2012-01-11)

  gprbuild fails when the project tree includes only aggregate projects and
  aggregate libraries projects. When gprbuild is called with a main project
  that is either an aggregate project or an aggregate library project,
  if auto-configuration is used, the configuration project file is created
  in the object directory of one of the non aggregate projects in the project
  tree.

NF-21-LA22-030 New Linker attribute Trailing_Switches (2012-12-29)

  A new attribute Trailing_Switches has been added in package Linker of
  project files. These switches are added in the linking command line
  after the required switches, so that they can override these switches.

NF-21-LA05-034 --config= in Builder switches (2012-12-24)

  gprbuild now takes into account a switch --config= in package Builder
  of the main project.

NF-21-L724-003 Empty Run_Path_Origin (2013-02-05)

  It is now allowed to specify attribute Run_Path_Origin as an empty
  string. This allows the run paths to be absolute paths. Then an executable
  may be moved to another directory without moving the shared libraries
  it needs.

NF-21-K826-028 Add support for distributed compilation (2012-12-19)

  It is now possible to use multiple computers to conduct the compilations.
  This can give good speed-up for large projects.
