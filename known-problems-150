The following is a listing of known problems in release 1.5.0. All these
problems have been corrected in the release 1.5.1 and in any wavefront
issued subsequent to the date specified (in ISO format YYYY-MM-DD) in the
status line. This can be used to determine if a given wavefront has the fix
identified in the entry.

KP-150-JC22-022 Duplicate rpaths when there are several mains

  Problem:    gprbuild keeps the rpaths from the previous mains when linking
              another main. That may leads to reach a limit in some platforms,
              and the link may then fail.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.5.1 on 2010-12-29

  Workaround: Invoke gprbuild to link one main at a time.

KP-150-JC09-012 Main in mixed cases on Windows

  Problem:    On Windows, if the mains in attributes Mains contain capital
              letters, linking executables may fail.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.5.1 on 2011-01-07

  Workaround: Use only small letters in attribute Main.

KP-150-JB09-027 Improper attempt to compile locally removed body

  Problem:    gprbuild attempts to compiled the body of a package that has
              been "locally removed" in an extended project.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.5.1 on 2010-11-09

  Workaround: Make sure the spec needs a body.

KP-150-J512-013 gprconfig's <executable> requires a prefix

  Problem:    In its knowledge base, gprconfig requires a valid prefix
              attribute for <executable> nodes.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.5.1 on 2010-12-01

  Workaround: Add prefix="-1" to <executable>
