NF-11-H402-020 Static lib projects may import standard projects (2008-04-02)

  The restriction that static library projects could only import library
  projects has been lifted. Shared library projects are still allowed to
  import only shared library projects.

NF-11-H324-006 Restricted imports of sources (2008-04-01)

  New functionalities have been added to restrict the set of sources or
  header files that can be inported:
    - switch --direct-import-only forbid sources of a projects to imports
      sources or header files of a project that is not directly withed.
    - attribute Interfaces lists the sources and header files that are allowed
      to be imported from sources of an importing project.

NF-11-H312-002 Languages with no compilers (2008-03-12)

  When the Compiler'Driver for a language is specified as the empty string,
  gprbuild is silently ignoring all of it sources. This is tru, by default,
  for language "Project File", when using automatic configuration.

NF-11-H226-001 All lib projects may import project without sources (2008-02-26)

  All library projects, including shared library projects, are allowed to
  import projects without any sources, even when this is not declared
  explicitly.

NF-11-H212-018 New attribute Inherit_Source_Path (2008-02-13)

  A new attribute Inherit_Source_Path allows sources of a language to import
  source or header file from another language. Example:
    for Inherit_Source_Path ("C++") use ("C");
  allows C++ sources to be compiled with a source search path that include
  all source directories of imported projects with C declared as a language.

NF-11-H117-025 Unrecognized gprbuild switches passed to compiler (2008-01-19)

  When gprbuild takes into account attribute Builder'Default_Switches (<lang>)
  any switch it does not recognizes is passed to the compiler of language
  <lang> for all sources of language <lang> in all projects.
