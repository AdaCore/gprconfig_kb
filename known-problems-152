KP-152-KA04-012 Pragma Linker_Options not honored

  Problem:    gprbuild does not pass libraries specified with a pragma
              Linker_Options to the linker.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.6.0 on 2011-10-06

  Workaround: Pass the corresponding libraries explicitly to the linker

KP-152-K801-014 Crash for library projects with no sources

  Problem:    gprbuild and gprclean crash with a library project with no
              sources that is not externally built.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.6.0 on 2011-08-02

  Workaround: Declare the library project as externally built.

KP-152-K711-032 Failure to build archive on Windows

  Problem:    On Windows, gprbuild may fail to build an archive if the
              length of the command line is greater than 8192.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.6.0 on 2011-07-22

  Workaround: Reduce the length of the object path names to reduce the
              length of the command line.
