NF-17-L126-014 Verbosity when linking shared SALs (2012-01-26)

  In default mode (not verbose and not quiet), the base name of gnatbind and
  of the compiler when binding and compiling the binder generated file is now
  output, instead of the full path names. Also, when the command line is long,
  only the beginning is output.

  gprbuild now support VxWorks Linux targets.

NF-17-K623-010 New switch --validate for gprconfig (2012-01-04)

  This switch can be used to validate the XML files from the gprconfig
  knowledge base. It should be used when you add your own XML files.

NF-17-JC09-030 New package Clean in project file (2012-03-30)

  A new package Clean is added in project files. It can contain declarations
  of attributes Source_Artifact_Extensions and Object_Artifact_Extensions,
  that specify the extensions of files whose names are derived from source or
  object file names, that reside in the object directory and that are to be
  cleaned by gprclean.
